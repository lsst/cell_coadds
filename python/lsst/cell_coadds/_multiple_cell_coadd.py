    Notes
    -----
    `MultipleCellCoadd` is designed to be used both by measurement algorithms
    that are able to take advantage of cell boundaries and overlap regions
    (which can use the ``.cells`` attribute to access `SingleCellCoadd` objects
    directly) and measurement algorithms that just want one image and don't
    care (or don't care much) about discontinuities (which can use `stitch` to
    obtain such an image).

    Indexing with `Box2I` yields a `MultipleCellCoadd` view containing just the
    cells that overlap that region.
