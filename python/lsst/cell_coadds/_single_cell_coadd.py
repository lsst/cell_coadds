    overlap that cell.

    Parameters
    ----------
    outer: `OwnedImagePlanes`
        The actual coadded images.
    psf : `ImageD`
        The coadded PSF image.
    inner_bbox: `Box2I`
        The bounding box of the inner region of this cell; must be disjoint
        with but adjacent to all other cell inner regions.
    inputs : `frozenset` of `ObservationIdentifiers`
        Identifiers of observations that contributed to this cell.
    common: `CommonComponents`
        Image attributes common to all cells in a patch.
    identifiers: `CellIdentifiers`
        Struct of identifiers for this cell.

    Notes
    -----
    At present we assume a single PSF image per cell is sufficient to capture
    spatial variability, which seems adequate given the results we have so far
    and the cell sizes we intend to use.
